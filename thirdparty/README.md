## miniupnpc

- Upstream: https://github.com/miniupnp/miniupnp
- Version: 2.2.8 (b55145ec095652289a59c33603f3abafee898273, 2024)
- License: BSD-3-Clause

Files extracted from upstream source:

- Copy `miniupnpc/src` and `miniupnpc/include` to `thirdparty/miniupnpc`
- Remove the following test or sample files:
  `listdevices.c,minihttptestserver.c,miniupnpcmodule.c,upnpc.c,upnperrors.*,test*`
- `LICENSE`

The only modified file is `src/miniupnpcstrings.h`, which was created for Godot
(it is usually autogenerated by cmake). Bump the version number for miniupnpc in
that file when upgrading.
